### Building KivaKit

KivaKit can be built in [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) or from the command line with Maven or the convenient scripts
below.

### Key Build Scripts

Once you have completed the [Setup](setup.md) process, it is easy to build projects from the command line with **kivakit-build.sh**.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| *kivakit-build.sh* | Builds KivaKit using the givens build type and modifiers (see below) |  
| *kivakit-build-documentation.sh* | Builds Javadoc and Lexakai documentation and uploads Javadoc to S3 |
| *kivakit-version.sh* | Shows the version of KivaKit you are building |

KivaKit scripts are named so that you can easily discover them with command-line completion.

To see what scripts are available, type "kivakit" and hit tab.

### Build Parameters

The **kivakit-build.sh** script takes a build-type parameter and zero or more build-modifier parameters.  
These parameters are translated into a particular set of maven switches and arguments. To see what  
build types are available, run *kivakit-build.sh help*:
